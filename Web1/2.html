<p>Sidebar file actions are limited to Delete/Rename for some reason. One of the most common tasks when working with projects is rearranging files or folders inside your project directory. Any time I need to quickly move files between folders, I can do it via fast sidebar drag-and-drop in pretty much ANY IDE or programmer editor (like Textmate). Except for ST2, for all its other niceties. Every time I need to copy or move a file I have to take detour into Finder which is VERY frustrating.</p>
